# MCAPS Tech Connect 2025 - M365 Agents SDK Lab

In this lab, you're going to create an agent using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK and the Azure Bot Service. Thanks to the capabilities of the SDK, you'll be able to create an agent powered by Generative AI that can be published and consumed across multiple channels, like Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot or even a custom web application.
You will learn how to:

1. Create a basic agent using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
2. Run the agent locally using the Bot Framework Emulator or in the cloud using the Web Chat
3. Add Generative AI capabilities to the agent using Semantic Kernel
